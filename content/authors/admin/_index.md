I am a research associate at the University of Bristol, in the School of Biological Sciences. My research focuses on vector biology and host-parasite interactions to improve disease control programs: from vector control to epidemiological modelling and decision making. 

I work on better understanding vector biology through evolutionary models with a focus on early life effects and vector competence and I am currently developing a model of maternal investment in the vector of Humand and Animal African Trypanosomiasis, the tsetse fly. I am also integrating more vector biology in epidemiological models of animal and human African trypanosomiasis. All that work is part of a BBSRC funded project focusing on epidemiological consequences of reproductive senescence in the tsetse fly, involving laboratory experiments conducted at LSTM, field work in Zimbabwe, and modeling work conducted between the Universities of Bristol, Oxford and Warwick.

I have a BSc, MSc and Engineer diploma in agricultural pest control from the university of Montpellier Sup Agro, France. I have a PhD in ecology and evolution of malaria mosquito immunity and vector competence from the University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland (2012-16). I carried on working on host-parasite interactions during his postdoc at Penn State University, USA (2016-19) and spent over two and a half years in Ivory Coast, West Africa. I was combining housing improvement and ecology as part of the trial of a new vector control tool for malaria, Eavetubes, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation
